 This is a little desktop drawing app written in good old Java with JavaFX, which was the last from a total of 18 coding assignments within two CS university degree programming courses.
 It was the last requirement to be admitted to the final examination. 
 
 The specification was to implement the app in OOP, which I did, while I took the liberty to slash the custom classes for every form and to summarize them inside one single "Figure" class since - at least in this use case - the differentiation of forms can be easily implemented just by different identifiers and corresponding computation methods.
 By that, I exchanged static app behavior and inert inheritance implications for reactive (and by the way, also more correct) runtime action when the figures adapt instantly to data changes of the aspect ratio done by the user.

 Features

 - Create colorful lines, squares, rectangles, circles, ellipses, or polygons with your mouse.
 - Select any drawn shape via mouse or over its index number.
 - Manipulate any drawn shape through data value input fields (x-position, y-position, width, height).
 - See the calculated area and circumference of any selected shape.
 - See the type name of the shape which dynamically switches when changing the aspect ratio in the data input fields (i.e., from 1: (x > 1) ("Rectangle") to 1:1 ("Square")).
 - The joy of creating as many abstract masterpieces as you want!

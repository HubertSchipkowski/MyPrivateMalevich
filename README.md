 This is a little desktop drawing app written in good old Java with JavaFX, which was the last from a total of 18 coding assignments within two CS university degree programming courses.
 It was the last requirement to be admitted to the final examination.

 Features

 - Create colorful lines, squares, rectangles, circles, ellipses, or polygons with your mouse
 - Select any drawn shape via mouse or over its index number
 - Manipulate any drawn shape through data value input fields (x-position, y-position, width, height)
 - See the calculated area and circumference of any selected shape
 - See the type name of the shape which dynamically switches when changing the aspect ratio in the data input fields (i.e., from 1: (x > 1) ("Rectangle") to 1:1 ("Square"))
 - Enjoy your abstract masterpiece!
